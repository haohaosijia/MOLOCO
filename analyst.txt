First I transfer the date format of the origin excel and save as a new csv file.
Then import the csv file to MySql By code:

create database moloco;
use moloco;
CREATE TABLE SAMPLE
(
TS DATETIME,
USER_ID VARCHAR(10),
COUNTRY_ID VARCHAR(10),
SITE_ID VARCHAR(10)
);
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "D:/job/ds/moloco/sample.txt" INTO TABLE moloco.sample
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
(TS, USER_ID, COUNTRY_ID, SITE_ID);

First question:
